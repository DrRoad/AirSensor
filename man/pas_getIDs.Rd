\usage{
pas_getIDs(
  pas = NULL,
  states = PWFSLSmoke::US_52,
  pattern = ".*",
  isOutside = TRUE,
  isParent = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pas}{PurpleAir Synoptic \emph{pas} object.}

\item{states}{Vector of recognized ISO state codes.}

\item{pattern}{Text pattern used to filter station labels.}

\item{isOutside}{Logical, is the sensor located outside?}

\item{isParent}{Logigal, is the sensor a parent station?}
}
\value{

\description{
The incoming \code{pas} object is first filtered based on the 
values of \code{states}, \code{patter}, \code{isOutside} and \code{isParent}.
The values associated with the \code{"ID"} column are then returned.

This function is useful for returning values associated with specific
\emph{devices}, which are represented by records with \code{isParent = TRUE}.
