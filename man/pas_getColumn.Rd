\arguments{
\item{pas}{PurpleAir Synoptic \emph{pas} object.}

\item{name}{Name of the column to return.}

\item{states}{Vector of recognized ISO state codes.}

\item{pattern}{Text pattern used to filter station labels.}

\item{isOutside}{Logical, is the sensor located outside?}

\description{
The incoming \code{pas} object is first filtered based on the 
values of \code{states}, \code{patter}, \code{isOutside} and \code{isParent}.
The values associated with the \code{name} column are then returned.

This function is useful for returning values associated with specific
\emph{devices}, which are represented by records with \code{isParent = TRUE}.
