# git branch "version-0.5" created on 2019-12-14
#
# This branch represents the first pass at processing Purple Air data.
# This version uses AirSensor 0.5 which uses the PAS `label` field.
# as a unique identifier. Starting with AirSensor 0.6, unique identifiers
# will be generated from a combination of a unique `locationID` and
# the device specific `ID` field.
