## PurpleAir Synoptic Functions

### `pas_loadLatest()`

`pas_loadLatest(baseUrl, countryCodes, includePWFSL, lookbackDays)`

> An AirSensor fundemental function to download, parse, and enhance synoptic 
data from PurpleAir and return the results as a useful tibble with class 
\code{pa_synoptic}. 

### `pas_load()`

`pas_load(datestamp, baseUrl)`

> Returns a pre-generated PurpleAir synoptic dataframe for all PurpleAir sensors 
for the day of interest.


### `pas_filter()`

`pas_filter(pas, ...)`

> A generalized data filter to choose rows/cases where argument conditions are 
valid. 

### `pas_filterArea()` 

`pas_filterArea(w, e, s, n)` 

> A filter to choose PurpleAir sensors that are contained inside a geographic 
bounding box provided by the user. 

### `pas_staticMap()`

`pas_staticMap(pas, parameter, palette, mapTheme, mapShape, direction, minScale, maxScale, shape, size, alpha, bbuff, zoomAdjust, ...)`

> Creates a thematic static map of a `pas` object containing many sensors. Can 
be used to show various PurpleAir sensor data.

### `pas_leaflet()` 

`pas_leaflet(pas, parameter, paletteName, radius, opacity, maptype, outsideOnly)`

> An interactive JavaScript map that can be used to map many PurpleAir sensors 
and their synoptic data.

## PurpleAir Timeseries Functions

### `pat_load()` 

`pat_load(pas, name, id, startdate, enddate, baseURL)`

> Retrieve and parse timeseries data from the Thingspeak API for specifically 
targeted PurpleAir sensors.

### `pat_filterData()`

`pat_filterData(pat, ...)`

> A generalized filter function for PurpleAir time series objects to choose 
rows/cases whre the argument conditions are valid.

### `pat_filterDate()` 

`pat_filterDate(pat, startdate, enddate, days, weeks, timezone)`

> A date interval filter for PurpleAir time series objects. 

### `pat_sample()`

`pat_sample(pat, sampleSize, sampleFraction, weight, setSeed, forGraphics)`

> A sampling function that reduces the size of large time series objects by 
randomly selecting distinct rows of the users choosen size. 

### `pat_scatterplot()`

`pat_scatterplot(pat, parameters, sampleSize, size, shape, color, alpha)`

> Creates a scatter matrix plot for comparing all variables in the PurpleAir 
time series object. A very useful tool to quickly find relationships and sensor characteristics. 

### `pat_outliers()`

`pat_outliers(pat, n, thresholdMin, replace, showPlot, data_shape, data_size, data_color, data_alpha, outlier_shape, outlier_size, outlier_color, outlier_alpha)`

> An outlier detection algorithm (using the hampel method) to quickly parse 
PurpleAir time series data for flagging likely erronous data. 

### `pat_dygraph()`

`pat_dygraph(pat, parameter, sampleSize, title, xlab, ylab, tlim, rollPeriod, showLegend, colors)` 

> Shows an interactive PurpleAir time series JavaScript graph. The function 
accepts a number of arguments for various PurpleAir sensor data.

### `pat_aggregate()`

`pat_aggregate(pat, period, stats, parameter, dataThreshold, pprobs, quickStats)`

> An aggregation function for PurpleAir time series data. Can flexibly aggregate 
data frames by different time periods and calculating various functional 
aggregation outouts. This function should be useful in many circumstances where 
it is necessary to work with different time average data.  

### `pat_internalFit()`

`pat_internalFit(pat, subset, weights, showPlot, size, shape, color, alpha, xylim)`

> Uses PurpleAir time series data from both Channel A and B to provide a 
relationship between both channels and visualize any divergence. 

### `pat_join()`

`pat_join(..., param)`

> A function to creat a union of any number of PurpleAir time series objects 
along a non-continuous datetime axis. 

### `pat_multiplot()`

`pat_multiplot(pat, plottype, sampleSize, plotList, columns, a_size, a_shape, a_color, b_size, b_shape, b_color, t_size, t_shape, t_color, h_size, h_shape, h_color, alpha)`

>  A plotting function that uses a boiler-plate util function to display 
multiple PurpleAir time series data in a single pane. Can be very useful for a 
quick PurpleAir sensor overview.
